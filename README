HDR 2nd Check
Copyright (c) 2012, Roy Keyes.

HDR 2nd Check is a basic program aimed at providing an automated, independent check of a high dose rate brachytherapy plan generated by BrachyVision/Eclipse (Varian Medical, Inc).

This program was started in July, 2012 as a response to the Eclipse 11 upgrade, which proved to be incompatible with the secondary check program "HDR Handcalc", upon which this program is based. This program is written entirely in Python and can hopefully be adapted to future changes with Eclipse/BrachyVision and other HDR planning systems.
